However, I think the strongest of all was the overarching story of power dynamics that seemed to persist no matter the time period.</p> <p>There are multiple places throughout the course that show the unique power dynamics of the internet. A lot of this is due to the way the modern internet system was built. As highlighted in the course, there are so many industries behind the network we use today and it's all built on the basis of the telegraph network. As such, a lot of the companies in the industry today have a long history in telecommunications. Examples of this include Bell, which started with telephones and is now a company with a huge amount of power in the internet business, especially here in Canada. Another example is Western Union. Although no longer a communications business, the company\u2019s beginnings in the telegraph and control in long-distance would lay the foundation for its modern position as a leading company for wire transfers. </p>"},{"location":"HIST1900/0_FinalJourney/0_FinalJourney_1/#the-journey-between-websitehist1900ideasthe-industries-behind-the-technology-and-websitehist1900atomicphone-company-monopoly","title":"The Journey Between website/HIST1900/Ideas/The Industries Behind the Technology and website/HIST1900/Atomic/phone company monopoly","text":"<ul> <li>The Industries Behind the Technology</li> <li>Lecture 7 - The First Internet; The Telegraph cont.</li> <li>Answer to the Francis Bacon Question</li> <li>Lecture 4 - The Silk Industry to Modern Computers</li> <li>natural progression of platforms</li> <li>@edwardssecretlifeBBS2022</li> <li>phone company monopoly</li> </ul> <p>This journey further highlights the link between these concepts. The industries that are behind the modern internet and all its precursors have led to a certain power structure. The path that internet history took has allowed for the monopolies that exist today, that as I mentioned, are especially prevalent in Canada. </p> <p>This idea also closely resembles the way that the pursuit of profits and capitalistic greed always seems to take over in the development of communications technology. With the patent wars at the beginning of the telegraph and the telephone,  the dotcom boom, and the overall enshitification of internet services, there is always fierce competition to try and make the most money off of human communications, and in many instances this communication hinders progress.</p>"},{"location":"HIST1900/0_FinalJourney/0_FinalJourney_1/#the-journey-between-websitehist1900hist-1900-lectureslecture-7-the-first-internet-the-telegraph-cont-and-websitehist1900ideascutting-costs-today","title":"The Journey Between website/HIST1900/HIST 1900 Lectures/Lecture 7 - The First Internet; The Telegraph cont. and website/HIST1900/Ideas/cutting costs today","text":"<ul> <li>Lecture 7 - The First Internet; The Telegraph cont.</li> <li>The Industries Behind the Technology</li> <li>Competences and Social Necessity Antikythera</li> <li>@winstonMediaTechnologySociety2002</li> <li>Prototype Rejection</li> <li>cutting costs today</li> </ul> <p>This journey sort of shows some of these links, with the start being the introduction of the telegraph, and the journey ending at a note where I highlighted how companies do everything they can to cut costs and maximize profits, often at the expense of people.</p> <p>These power dynamics also call to mind the role of the military in the development of the internet. Across the timeline of the course, the military was crucial in the development of technology, as I highlighted in my notes, such as Technology Development for Military.</p>"},{"location":"HIST1900/0_FinalJourney/0_FinalJourney_1/#the-journey-between-websitehist1900ideasthe-industries-behind-the-technology-and-websitehist1900atomictechnology-development-for-military","title":"The Journey Between website/HIST1900/Ideas/The Industries Behind the Technology and website/HIST1900/Atomic/Technology Development for Military","text":"<ul> <li>The Industries Behind the Technology</li> <li>Lecture 7 - The First Internet; The Telegraph cont.</li> <li>Answer to the Francis Bacon Question</li> <li>Lecture 4 - The Silk Industry to Modern Computers</li> <li>natural progression of platforms</li> <li>many platforms, same function</li> <li>@understandingmediaculture2010</li> <li>why no security</li> <li>@housleyEvolutionEmailSecurity2022 </li> <li>Technology Development for Military</li> </ul> <p>This journey shows the line of thought I'm drawing on for this, with the origin being in the same place as the story of monopolies. To draw on some examples to emphasize the importance of the military, one can look at the optical telegraph. For France and the UK, the optical telegraph could relay military information, especially at a time when there was tension between the two countries. In more modern times, many of the advancements in early computer communications and security were the result of military need, such as WWII communications and cold war communication technology. This military demand created a certain power dynamic that gave governments an excuse to make executive decisions over internet networks.</p> <p>Something else which I do not have separate notes on but was highlighted in lectures was the often silenced role of women in the development of the internet. So much of the behind the scenes coding and work was done by women, whereas men receive the credit for their contributions. This goes as far back as the women hired as the original telephone operators, to replace the unreliable telegraph boys, mentioned in Lecture 8 - From Telegraph to Telephone#^0cf563. </p> <p>Through all these things combined, I think the result of this class is clear. The most powerful thing I learned is not the machines and technological systems that work to bring the internet together, but the people and human systems that do. The stories of the people, both sung and unsung, will ultimately be my greatest takeaway from the course.</p>"},{"location":"HIST1900/0_FinalJourney/0_FinalJourney_2/","title":"0 FinalJourney 2","text":"<p>My answer to the question of whether I met my goals for the course is somewhat double-edged.

In the tutorial level, I wrote that some keywords for my aim to be \"technology, advancement, evolution\". By this metric, I think my goals were met.

The first note mentions Winston's progression model, which offers a good lens to study advancements in communication.  Throughout the journey is a range of notes of instances or ideas that highlight technology's nature to build on existing tech and evolve with it. An example is the way that in a long train of events, the ancient silk industry created the modern 80-character standard length for computer terminals. Another example is my note where I observed that it is the natural progression of technology for similar platforms to appear at the same time as the need arises, which is in line with Winston's model. </p> <p>In this way, my goal was met. I learned a lot about how technology advances, by evolving to meet current needs, using old methods. However, there is another goal that I feel I didn't quite meet. </p> <p>Going into the course, I think I expected it to be less of a history of communication and the development of the internet, and more of a look at how online culture evolved, changed, and I suppose, toxified over the years. I suppose Lecture 14 - Online Culture in the 70s and 80s - 2023-03-20 and Lecture 16 - The 90s - 2023-03-27 is what I was expecting the entire course to be. I enjoyed those lectures, as they were more in line with what I really expected heading into things. I would've liked to learn more about these aspects, and I'd say the fact that I didn't is on me. With the open-ended nature of the memex, I definitely could've found more sources and focused my third assessment on a lot of the culture surrounding the internet as it developed in the early days. However, I got more tied up thinking about the technical and logistical aspects, forgetting my original goals. </p> <p>This is not to say I didn't enjoy what I learned. Looking at things in hindsight, I feel my original expectations may not have been feasible to create a university course from, but who knows? In the end, I am happy with what I accomplished through this class, even if it's not what I originally anticipated. The things I learned here have definitely added an extra layer of appreciation to a lot of the technologies I've taken for granted every day of my life.</p>"},{"location":"HIST1900/Administrative%20%28Read%20First%21%29/Explanation%20of%20Memex%202/","title":"memex-2","text":"<p>The majority of information added for this second memex assessment has to do with the Antikythera Mechanism.

This reminded me greatly of the contents of the class, and as such I found myself reading about it, which is where the majority of the sources I included come from.

Claude Chappe invented a form of telegraph using maneuverable arms. This method was preferred for wartime communication in 18th-century France and was adapted across Europe. Attempts to create an electrical way to send messages were rejected by the state, as the current method was considered adequate, and further research was unnecessary during peacetime.</p> <p>Chapter 2: After being unable to get news of his wife's death until she was already buried, American Samuel Morse becomes obsessed with creating an electric telegraph. Not a man of science, he creates a code for sending letters but struggles with creating a method of sending it over long wires, until getting the help of Leonard Gale, a professor of chemistry at New York University.</p> <p>Simultaneously in Britain, William Cooke is in a similar situation. He creates a way of sending messages but also struggles with sending them over long distances. He eventually forms a partnership with Charles Wheatstone, a scientist who worked in the field of electricity. Together, through a rocky partnership, they devised a way to send messages over long distances and thus telegraphs emerged from multiple parts of the world at once.</p> <p>Chapter 5: The job of getting a telegraph line across the Atlantic Ocean was a messy one. It took many attempts, and the first successful connection broke in a number of weeks. This was mainly due to the fact that the man in charge of the design of the original wire, Wildman Whitehouse, was nowhere near as experienced as someone should be for the job. After the mass celebration of the connection, the public disappointment was massive. For the second cable, William Thomson designed the cable, which would eventually stand successful and finally link Europe and North America, in what, at the time, was seen as the ultimate technology for keeping world peace.</p> <p>Chapter 12: This book really shows its age in this chapter. Standage points out a number of the similarities between the telegraph and the internet, citing parallels between the behaviour and situations both have inspired. He also condemns the blind optimism that many have towards the internet, claiming that this same optimism is what failed during the time of the Atlantic cable. It is interesting to see the predictions at the time, such as remote working, that would eventually become true.</p>"},{"location":"HIST1900/HIST%201900%20Source%20Notes/%40standageVictorianInternetRemarkable1998/#links","title":"Links","text":"<p>Put any links to separate notes you have teased out here.</p>"},{"location":"HIST1900/HIST%201900%20Source%20Notes/%40stephensDeadEyesOpen2015/","title":"@stephensDeadEyesOpen2015","text":"<p>Title: @stephensDeadEyesOpen2015 date: 2023-02-09 type: reference project:</p> <p>tags:: #pop-culture #intertwining-tecnology #technology-evolution #memex-1 projects:</p>"},{"location":"HIST1900/HIST%201900%20Source%20Notes/%40stephensDeadEyesOpen2015/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<p>Stephens, E. 2015 \u201cDead Eyes Open\u201d: The Role of Experiments in Galvanic Reanimation in Nineteenth-Century Popular Culture.

The only reason I can think of for this is that it simply wasn't needed that early on. When networks were so small, most people on the network were working for good, and with so few people, finding a perpetrator wouldn't be too difficult. Essentially, everyone was working together for progress, so to borrow the analogy used to explain early emails in this explanation, having security on these messages would be like having security measures to protect a note that a coworker left on your desk. Security only really would have become a concern as the first viruses came around.</p> <p>Looking back I realize I had made note of this back in Lecture 14 - Online Culture in the 70s and 80s - 2023-03-20#^378bce</p> <p>@housleyEvolutionEmailSecurity2022 @understandingmediaculture2010 early email security developing email security Lecture 15 - Hypertext and the Web - 2023-03-22#^2e8bcf</p>"}]}
