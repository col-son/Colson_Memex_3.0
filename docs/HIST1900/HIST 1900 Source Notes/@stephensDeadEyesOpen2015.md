### Summary & Key Take Aways

In this short paper, Stephens outlines a number of the notable galvanic experiments that occurred in the late 1700s to mid-1800s. She also touches on how these experiments and the relatively new concept of electricity became such appealing topics for fictional entertainment in the period. 

With this look at things, it is easy to see how stories such as Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*
became so popular. In a way, such a story could be compared to modern-day stories involving AI takeovers, such as *Detroit: Become Human*.
