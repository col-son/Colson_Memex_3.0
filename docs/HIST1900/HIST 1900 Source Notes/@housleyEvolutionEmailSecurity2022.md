### Summary & Key Take Aways

Housley gives a short history of the development and implementation of different security measures for use in email communication. Much of the technical jargon is lost on me, however, I was able to grasp some key ideas. As the use of email grew, particularly in government and military instances, the need for new security around communication became clear (6). These measures have evolved over time to suit new technology and needs, but some of the core concepts established at the beginning serve as a blueprint for the way things are done nowadays (6).
