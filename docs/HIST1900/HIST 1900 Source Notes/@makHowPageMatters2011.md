### Summary & Key Take Aways

Mak describes the evolution of the page, the method of delivery of written information.
From this, I really feel the idea of the page itself carrying as much info as what is written on it, such as lowering quality paper pointing to the economic conditions of the time.

I'd like to read more of this, because I find it hard to see how these implicit messages are carried as so much of today's publication is purely digital, such as newspapers. Perhaps in the future, the fact that things all became digital in a rapid time period is in and of itself the story that the page is telling, so to speak.
