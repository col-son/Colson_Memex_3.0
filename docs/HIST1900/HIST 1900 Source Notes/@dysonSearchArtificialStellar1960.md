### Summary & Key Take Aways

Dyson proposes a way to search for extraterrestrial life forms, by looking for sources of infrared radiation, specifically at nearby stars. In doing so he also sparks the first discussion of the Dyson Sphere, a hypothetical structure that encompasses a star and harnesses its energy. This is the sort of energy source that Dyson imagines any species that has been industrialized for a few thousand years would use.

>> Sort of goes along with the idea discussed by Bush, the limit of technology isn't the ideas of the people, but the resources at the time.

> One should expect that, within a few thousand years of its entering the stage of industrial development, any intelligent species should be found occupying an artificial biosphere which completely surrounds its parent star

>> The Dyson Sphere. Almost sounds like a way of weirdly escaping climate change<i>, </i>going closer to the sun. Worth noting here that Dyson actually saw increased CO2 levels as potentially beneficial.

> A scan of the entire sky for objects down to the 5th or 6th magnitude would be desirable, but is probably beyond the capability of existing techniques of detection.

>> Not what I came here for, but definitely in line.
