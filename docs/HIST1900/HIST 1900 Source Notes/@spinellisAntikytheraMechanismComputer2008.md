### Summary & Key Take Aways

The Antikythera mechanism is a 2000-year-old bronze analog computer, designed by the Ancient Greeks (22). The device was discovered by sponge divers in 1900 (22). The device is a calender computer, which tracks the movement of the sun and can be used to track the date, and predict eclipses and lunar phases (23).

> In 1900, a group of sponge fishers seeking shelter from the Kythera Sea’s cruel weather anchored their boats on the barren island of Antikythera. Continuing their diving there, they discovered at a depth of 42 meters an ancient shipwreck with bronze and marble statues.

>> Similar to past mentions, thinking about the average people who make discoveries possible. These divers are elaborated on in Jo Marchant's <i>Decoding the Heavens</i>

>> Not quite the same, but the tracking of celestial bodies with an analog computer definitely has similarities to Kelvin's tide calculator
