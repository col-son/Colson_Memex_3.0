### Summary & Key Take Aways

This piece gives a very similar summary to that taught in class by Dr. Graham. From the viewpoint of this summary, the internet is described not as a place but as a set of protocols that allow communication between different devices. The piece credits much of the success of the internet to its decentralized and open nature. However, it touches on the issue of the early dotcom boom, where websites were overfunded due to the unknown nature of the new investment opportunity.
