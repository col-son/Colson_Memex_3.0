My answer to the question of whether I met my goals for the course is somewhat double-edged. In some ways, I'd say that I did, but in others, I didn't quite reach it. 

I'll start this answer with the success. In the tutorial level, I wrote that some keywords for my aim to be "technology, advancement, evolution". By this metric, I think my goals were met. A lot of the learning I did in the course was about the advancements of technology and how they evolve with each other.

## The Journey Between website/HIST1900/Atomic/Winston's Model for More and website/HIST1900/Ideas/natural progression of platforms
- [[Winston's Model for More]]
- [[Competences and Social Necessity Antikythera]]
- [[The Industries Behind the Technology]]
- [[Lecture 7 - The First Internet; The Telegraph cont.]]
- [[Answer to the Francis Bacon Question]]
- [[Lecture 4 - The Silk Industry to Modern Computers]]
- [[natural progression of platforms]]

In this journey, you can see a lot of notes that highlight these keywords. The first note mentions Winston's progression model, which offers a good lens to study advancements in communication.  Throughout the journey is a range of notes of instances or ideas that highlight technology's nature to build on existing tech and evolve with it. An example is the way that in a long train of events, the ancient silk industry created the modern 80-character standard length for computer terminals. Another example is my note where I observed that it is the natural progression of technology for similar platforms to appear at the same time as the need arises, which is in line with Winston's model. 

In this way, my goal was met. I learned a lot about how technology advances, by evolving to meet current needs, using old methods. However, there is another goal that I feel I didn't quite meet. 

Going into the course, I think I expected it to be less of a history of communication and the development of the internet, and more of a look at how online culture evolved, changed, and I suppose, toxified over the years. I suppose [[Lecture 14 - Online Culture in the 70s and 80s - 2023-03-20]] and [[Lecture 16 - The 90s - 2023-03-27]] is what I was expecting the entire course to be. I enjoyed those lectures, as they were more in line with what I really expected heading into things. I would've liked to learn more about these aspects, and I'd say the fact that I didn't is on me. With the open-ended nature of the memex, I definitely could've found more sources and focused my third assessment on a lot of the culture surrounding the internet as it developed in the early days. However, I got more tied up thinking about the technical and logistical aspects, forgetting my original goals. 

This is not to say I didn't enjoy what I learned. Looking at things in hindsight, I feel my original expectations may not have been feasible to create a university course from, but who knows? In the end, I am happy with what I accomplished through this class, even if it's not what I originally anticipated. The things I learned here have definitely added an extra layer of appreciation to a lot of the technologies I've taken for granted every day of my life.
