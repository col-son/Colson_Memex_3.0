I learned a few things that struck me in this course that I had never considered about the internet. However, I think the strongest of all was the overarching story of power dynamics that seemed to persist no matter the time period.

There are multiple places throughout the course that show the unique power dynamics of the internet. A lot of this is due to the way the modern internet system was built. As highlighted in the course, there are so many industries behind the network we use today and it's all built on the basis of the telegraph network. As such, a lot of the companies in the industry today have a long history in telecommunications. Examples of this include Bell, which started with telephones and is now a company with a huge amount of power in the internet business, especially here in Canada. Another example is Western Union. Although no longer a communications business, the companyâ€™s beginnings in the telegraph and control in long-distance would lay the foundation for its modern position as a leading company for wire transfers.

This journey further highlights the link between these concepts. The industries that are behind the modern internet and all its precursors have led to a certain power structure. The path that internet history took has allowed for the monopolies that exist today, that as I mentioned, are especially prevalent in Canada. 

This idea also closely resembles the way that the pursuit of profits and capitalistic greed always seems to take over in the development of communications technology. With the patent wars at the beginning of the telegraph and the telephone,  the dotcom boom, and the overall enshitification of internet services, there is always fierce competition to try and make the most money off of human communications, and in many instances this communication hinders progress.

This journey sort of shows some of these links, with the start being the introduction of the telegraph, and the journey ending at a note where I highlighted how companies do everything they can to cut costs and maximize profits, often at the expense of people.

These power dynamics also call to mind the role of the military in the development of the internet. Across the timeline of the course, the military was crucial in the development of technology, as I highlighted in my notes, such as [[Technology Development for Military]].

This journey shows the line of thought I'm drawing on for this, with the origin being in the same place as the story of monopolies. To draw on some examples to emphasize the importance of the military, one can look at the optical telegraph. For France and the UK, the optical telegraph could relay military information, especially at a time when there was tension between the two countries. In more modern times, many of the advancements in early computer communications and security were the result of military need, such as WWII communications and cold war communication technology. This military demand created a certain power dynamic that gave governments an excuse to make executive decisions over internet networks.

Something else which I do not have separate notes on but was highlighted in lectures was the often silenced role of women in the development of the internet. So much of the behind the scenes coding and work was done by women, whereas men receive the credit for their contributions. This goes as far back as the women hired as the original telephone operators, to replace the unreliable telegraph boys, mentioned in [[Lecture 8 - From Telegraph to Telephone#^0cf563]]. 

Through all these things combined, I think the result of this class is clear. The most powerful thing I learned is not the machines and technological systems that work to bring the internet together, but the people and human systems that do. The stories of the people, both sung and unsung, will ultimately be my greatest takeaway from the course.
