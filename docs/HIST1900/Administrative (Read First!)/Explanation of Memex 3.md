#memex-3 

Well! The final assessment! This time there wasn't quite a single theme like last time, but there were still a couple of things that had most of my attention. I spent a good amount of my time looking at things involving security, which often left me confused. I also looked into AI and some of its potential for the future. 

However, I'd say the biggest part of this memex edition for me was moments where things just started to really *click*. There were just a number of instances where I was like "aha!" and suddenly it made sense, how something from way early on in the course connected to what I'm working on now. 

That being said, I hope you enjoy the third and final version of my memex for this course, it's been quite the *journey* (haha did you see what I did there...cause like the final journey...and...).
