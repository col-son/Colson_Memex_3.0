- Thinking back to assemblages and emerging tech, how do we untangle and make sense of this?
- Work of Brian Winston: Historian of Science
	- communication technologies are a performance of scientific competence
	- certain social aspects must be built up before the performance can take place
	- from idea to technology, there is a transformation, taking place within the social sphere
		- some things don't work out, and as such we have parallel developing tech and prototypes
	- a technology is more than the scientific base or idea, but also the social conditions that it is fitting into
- the telegraph
	- social sphere develops a need for mass communication
		- major world powers who have massive empires need a way to communicate across them quickly
- 1814, Ralph Wedgewood comes up with an electrical scheme for sending signals, the admiralty says no
- 1816, Francis Ronald comes up with one, using synchronized clocks with letters, admiralty says no
- They also decided all telegrams development is not needed, as the existing systems will suffice
- with the emergence of the railroad, the need for high-speed signals becomes realized
- Legal battles over technology as multiple people come up with the idea at the same time, and go to the railroad companies
	- Davy vs Cooke and Wheatstone, Cooke and Wheatstone win out
	- The Cooke and Wheatstone method which becomes popular uses 5 wires and combinations to send signals, using the galvanometer
- Enter Samuel Morse
	- Mainly a painter, but took some classes in electricity during his time at Yale
	- Learns of recent experiments with electricity on the return of one of his trips from Europe
	- Finds himself unable to solve the issue of constant electricity until he meets Joseph Henry
	- Uses relay to negate the issues, the key to efficiency is to use code
	- Uses the way printers organize their letters in order to help develop a new code
