- By the late 19th century, as new communication devices arise, networks are an established idea
	- think rail, pipe, sewer networks
- Bell is promoting the idea of creating a comprehensive network for telephones, featuring central offices that branch out into many more
	- Phones were originally sold in pairs, with just direct lines between each other, which contradicted this aforementioned idea
	- This eventually changes as the network begins to build
- First woman central office operator: Emma Nutt, 1878
	- connect to a central office, ask for who you want to, and the worker will connect you
	- As Bell said, women were better on the job, they were more reliable and didn't show up drunk
- The Strowger automatic exchange: 1892
	- created to circumvent the need for a human operator
	- this was resisted, as people did not want to be assigned a number that they would then have to type in
- It took a while for phones to catch on, the first two decades featured a very slow rise
	- there were a number of issues, the quality wasn't great and could be interfered by a number of factors
- In Boston, a number of new changes happen to the Bell company
	- goes from National Bell to American Bell
	- New investors
	- Hubbard and Bell are no longer in management Bell
	- Theodore Vail comes in charge
	- Western Union deal ([[Lecture 8 - From Telegraph to Telephone Memex 2#^1e889c]]) still going
	- Vail's plan is to buy out small companies as patents are expiring
		- He know's the money is in long distance, which he is suppose to stay out of, leaving it to Western Union
- 1884: long distance phoneline created from New York to Boston
	- A subdisadry company created to do this
	- Lab created to improve the technology
- 1888: Bell wins the court battles over the original patents
	- begins making tons of money, even in the depression
	- however, these patents are all about to expire
- Independent companies popping up, ignoring patents
	- Bell fights these, with court cases
	- extreme undercutting of competition
	- refuse to link with other systems
	- buy up stocks of other companies, and then take control
- Farmers realize they can connect to each other using their already existing wires
- With this competition and separation, many people will have two phones, for different systems
	- class divide, wealthy on Bell system and others on cheaper systems
- American competition causes huge costs, especially more expensive in certain cities ^abef71
- Meanwhile in Europe, costs are low and quality is equal, as phonelines are nationalized under post offices
- costs for phone calls are super expensive for long distance
	- this leads to people pooling together to get a phone, public phones
- made possible through the vacuum tube, as it lets the signal be amplified
- Bell is making huge money still, and also seems to be director customers to telegraphs that they have a large stake in 
	- antitrust legislation attempted, as other countries continue to nationalize their phone companies
- Bell labs are continuing their research
	- Incentive: any money put into research can be offset against profit
- Claude Shannon: Grad student at MIT under Vanaveer Bush
	- Bush is working on analog computers
	- Shannon joins bell labs in WWII, working on control systems for firing weapons
	- Invents Information Technology
	- His MA thesis creates the foundation form modern technology
		- Boole: Creator of Boolean algebra
		- Shannon comes up with the idea of using Boolean operations across electronic signals
		- He proves that circuits can convey logic
- Redundancy is the key to understanding language
- In 1948 Claude Shannon comes up with the idea that a message is comprised of two things:
	- the content
	- the info
		- info is a measurement of the redundancy of the content or how surprising/how easy to predict the next sound/wave/letter is
- the 20th century is essentially the combination of Information Theory and the separation of a message from it's meaning
