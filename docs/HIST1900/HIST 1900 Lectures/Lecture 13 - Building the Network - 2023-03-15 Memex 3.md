- The connections mentioned in the last lecture weren't really the internet
	- "Internet" involves a number of things communicating, not just two computers talking
- pinpointing the exact start of the internet is difficult, it is really a culmination of a bunch of factors converging at different times
- INTERnet -> connecting multiple networks
- France is up to their own computer infrastructure
	- join the packet switch game
	- create CYCLADES in 1971, demo in 1973 and fully operational in 1976
	- datagram data+telegram 
	- makes the host do an error connection not the router
	- routers ensure transparency 
	- connectivity becomes easier
- French embassy is suggesting French connect their system to the ARPAnet
- Laying a wire would have cost 13M Francs
- University of Hawaii
	- ALOHAnet
	- UofH campus' is spread across islands in a 300km radius
	- wires over ocean expensive, decide to broadcast data of radio instead 
	- solve a number of technical issues 
- SATnet
	- proposal to connect places by satellite
	- ARPAnet was already connected to another lab by satellite, watching out for seismic data
	- idea to use this connection to go to National Physical Laboratory 
	- instead connect to University College London, less government interference 
- PRnet
	- packet radio network
	- ALOHAnet but on a truck 
- European Informatics Network
	- created to share resources by the predecessor of EU
- Some networks are unofficial 
	- Pam Hardt
	- puts computer in a spot where people can leave messages behind
	- essentially talking to each other, building a network
- How do you keep track of all this info?
	- Elizabeth 'Jake' Feinler
	- tasked with creating a resource handbook
		- what is that? no one knows but it needs to be done in 6 weeks
		- must make a way to track around 30 nodes in the network at ARPAnet
		- a directory of every person on the ARPAnet and how to find them
			- created by phoning people up or sending messages on the net
			- 1000 pages, comprehensive record
			- essentially the infrastructure for finding people up until yahoo came out
- This task seemed administrative and simply a necessary step, but was extremely important in the evolution of the internet
- the early 70s, non-government agencies emerge, and national competition
- still issues, it's working at a technical level but still hard to make useful
- First International Conference on Computer Communications - Washington 1972
	- lots of demos
		- air traffic simulation
		- real-time conferencing
		- computerized chess
		- ELIZA program - an original chatgpt
- Unintended users
	- Michael Hart U of Illinois
		- posts declaration of independence in 1972, start of project Guternberg
	- MIT students use the IMP to speed up local communications, not even sending info to ARPAnet
	- Games begin to spread, which was not the intended use at all
- Email saves the info sharing purpose ^8d435c
	- write a message and drop it into a file on another computer - a mailbox
- Alohanet gets adapted by Xerox Palo Alto Research Center
	- make wired connection - ethernet
	- work on making different types of systems for different uses 
- Transmission Control Protocol out by 1973
	- helps make reliable connections between different computers
- The way this happened helped prevent boundaries such as national ones
- However, connecting these different networks requires "gateway computers" as companies buy old telegraph buildings to house these facilities 
- TCP splits into TCP/IP in 1973
- Consumer computers emerge, and governments concerned, who is on for civilian reasons and who is on for defence
- phone phreaks - can get free long distance by whistling?
