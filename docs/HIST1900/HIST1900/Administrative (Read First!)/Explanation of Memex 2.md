#memex-2

The majority of information added for this second memex assessment has to do with the Antikythera Mechanism. 
Around the time of the lectures focusing on the development of the telegraph and computer, I found a video which introduced me to the Antikythera Mechanism, an ancient Greek analog calender-computer. This reminded me greatly of the contents of the class, and as such I found myself reading about it, which is where the majority of the sources I included come from. 
Things new to this assessment have been marked with "Memex 2" at the end of the title, and some minor changes may have been added to older notes.
