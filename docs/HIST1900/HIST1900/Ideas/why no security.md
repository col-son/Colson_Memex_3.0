I haven't been able to connect the dots in the way I'd like to when it comes to issues arising with early email systems, which seem lax in security, based on the way I've seen them explained. The only reason I can think of for this is that it simply wasn't needed that early on. When networks were so small, most people on the network were working for good, and with so few people, finding a perpetrator wouldn't be too difficult. Essentially, everyone was working together for progress, so to borrow the analogy used to explain early emails in [this explanation](https://open.lib.umn.edu/mediaandculture/chapter/11-2-the-evolution-of-the-internet/), having security on these messages would be like having security measures to protect a note that a coworker left on your desk. Security only really would have become a concern as the first viruses came around.

Looking back I realize I had made note of this back in [[Lecture 14 - Online Culture in the 70s and 80s - 2023-03-20#^378bce]]
