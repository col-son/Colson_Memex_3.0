- the idea of computers filling in gaps in messages seems much more attainable with the recent development of ai language models
	- these models can have their issues, but they're definitely much better than the standard predictive text on say, iPhones
- perhaps worth looking into more
	- further research might connect nicely with the [class annotations](https://hyp.is/go?url=https%3A%2F%2Fshawngraham.github.io%2Fhist1900%2Fassets%2Fslides%2Fmar27&group=__world__) of Section 230 of the communications decency act.
