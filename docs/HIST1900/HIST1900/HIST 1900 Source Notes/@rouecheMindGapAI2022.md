### Summary & Key Take Aways

I was looking for writing about the advancement of computers and AI when it comes to filling in gaps in messages, I found an article I considered interesting. It was about a tool used by historians to study ancient Greek tests. In many tests the AI was able to identify texts with more accuracy than scholars, due to years of data it was trained on. This opens up opportunities for quicker analysis of things that may be more minor, allowing researchers to focus in other important tasks. 

The main focus was emphasizing that this technology should not replace the work of historians, but rather supplement it, as shown by the extracted sentences below.

> The use of AI should not render the scholar redundant, but should instead challenge their understanding of what they thought they knew.
