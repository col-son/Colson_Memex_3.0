### Summary & Key Take Aways

In this intro chapter to his book *Media, Technology and Society: A History: From the Telegraph to the Internet*, Brian Winston introduces a model for the historical development of telecommunication devices. I wanted to read this explanation as I was a admittedly little confused by the explanation in the lecture. I originally thought the theory was to be applied to all inventions, but I still think it loosely can fit in most situations.

> Technologies are, as it were, utterances of a scientific language, performances of a scientific competence
>
>> This explanation makes this theory make more sense.

> Ideation occurs when the technologist envisages the device—gets the idea, formulates the problems involved and hypothesises a solution.

> Now these generalised forces coalesce to function as a transforming agency which I will call supervening social necessities

> The prototype can be rejected because a supervening necessity has not yet operated and no possible use for the device is seen

> A German thought of the telegraph in the last years of the eighteenth century, three decades before the first working device. A Frenchman hypothesised the telephone in 1854, more than 20 years before Bell

>> And people still do this today, claiming they had an idea before it was invented.

> [!quote|#ff6666] Highlight
> A technologically induced hara-kiri on the part of these institutions, whereby a business ‘invents’ a device which puts it out of business, is obviously impossible.

>> I truly don't believe this...I think even if it is in the very far future automation could do this to some corporations, even if in an indirect, twisted way.
