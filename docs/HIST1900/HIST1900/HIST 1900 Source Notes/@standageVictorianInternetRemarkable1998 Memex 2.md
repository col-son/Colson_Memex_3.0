### Summary & Key Take Aways

Chapter 1:
As many looked for a way to transport messages across long distances, one of the simplest answers proved the most efficient. Claude Chappe invented a form of telegraph using maneuverable arms. This method was preferred for wartime communication in 18th-century France and was adapted across Europe. Attempts to create an electrical way to send messages were rejected by the state, as the current method was considered adequate, and further research was unnecessary during peacetime.

Chapter 2:
After being unable to get news of his wife's death until she was already buried, American Samuel Morse becomes obsessed with creating an electric telegraph. Not a man of science, he creates a code for sending letters but struggles with creating a method of sending it over long wires, until getting the help of Leonard Gale, a professor of chemistry at New York University.

Simultaneously in Britain, William Cooke is in a similar situation. He creates a way of sending messages but also struggles with sending them over long distances. He eventually forms a partnership with Charles Wheatstone, a scientist who worked in the field of electricity. Together, through a rocky partnership, they devised a way to send messages over long distances and thus telegraphs emerged from multiple parts of the world at once.

Chapter 5:
The job of getting a telegraph line across the Atlantic Ocean was a messy one. It took many attempts, and the first successful connection broke in a number of weeks. This was mainly due to the fact that the man in charge of the design of the original wire, Wildman Whitehouse, was nowhere near as experienced as someone should be for the job. After the mass celebration of the connection, the public disappointment was massive. For the second cable, William Thomson designed the cable, which would eventually stand successful and finally link Europe and North America, in what, at the time, was seen as the ultimate technology for keeping world peace.

Chapter 12:
This book really shows its age in this chapter. Standage points out a number of the similarities between the telegraph and the internet, citing parallels between the behaviour and situations both have inspired. He also condemns the blind optimism that many have towards the internet, claiming that this same optimism is what failed during the time of the Atlantic cable. It is interesting to see the predictions at the time, such as remote working, that would eventually become true.
