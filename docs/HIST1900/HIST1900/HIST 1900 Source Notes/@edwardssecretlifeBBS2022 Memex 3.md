### Summary & Key Take Aways

This gives an inside look at what it was like to be a young person on the internet during its breakthrough years. A really good look at the culture of the time, and what went on in these online spaces. It's interesting to see how file sizes that were considered huge back then are minuscule by today's standards, with a single megabyte file taking an hour to download. Nowadays we complain if our download speed isn't enough MB per second. It's also fascinating to see how the previously established telephone industry really had such control over the early internet.
