### Summary & Key Take Aways

Another sort of technical explanation of something, explaining the process behind what seems like a very simple act, sending a text. In this however, the first half explains things in a much more manageable way, that I was able to understand. 

What I found most interesting from this was drawing connections to the way other things leading up to the internet worked historically, once again following a train of thought similar to the one I had in [[natural progression of platforms Memex 3]].
