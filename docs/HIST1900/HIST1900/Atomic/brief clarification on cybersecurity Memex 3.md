In my note about the source [[@housleyEvolutionEmailSecurity2022]], I mentioned that a lot of the technical jargon had me confused while reading. [joseph's explanation](https://jmcn99.github.io/hist1900-memex/atomic_notes/data%20integrity/) of some of the basics of cybersecurity helped clear things up a little bit for me. It's a simple explanation of something much bigger, but the clarification was very helpful.
