Just sort of an interesting note of how things have improved. This sort of thing was an issue in early computer communication, and in a direct sense computers may have difficulty filling in gaps. However, this definitely falls along the same lines. 

This is in contrast to something I saw the other day about early technology. Humans can interpret a missing bit of a message but machines cannot. It was material for this course but I forget what exactly.
