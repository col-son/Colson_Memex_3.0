An annotation from a text, which stands by itself. The monopolies established early on which allowed companies to drive up long distance costs to ridiculous amounts would have an effect on the early internet systems. 

interesting to see how this stems from the long-distance phone charges, which coincides with the monopolies established in the development of America's telephone network.
