The majority of technological advancements come as a result of military need. This reminds me of a short documentary I watched a bit back that was talking about the development of GPS systems. It mentioned how high-accuracy, high-speed GPS was developed for military use but made available to the public as consumer GPS was developed. Shortly after, the new public use slowed down military systems, so commercial GPS was switched to a slower network. I'm pretty sure the doc mentioned there was a lot of complaints as a result, but I don't remember if anything came of it. I'll have to try and remember the documentary name to go and check.
