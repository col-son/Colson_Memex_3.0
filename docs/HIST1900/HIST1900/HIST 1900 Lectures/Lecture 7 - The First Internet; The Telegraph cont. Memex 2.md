- Advancers and breaking forces of the telegraph
	- legal battles over patents
	- France simply nationalizes telegraph
	- The US buys telegraph technology from Morse, but then sells it back after deciding it is too much of a drain on resources
- 19th century, stock trading becomes a thing
	- the ability to keep track of and trade stocks the fastest becomes advantageous
- **Read about social history of the emergence of the telegraph - Standage** 
- Multiple services for telegraphs emerge
	- Henry O'Reilly secures rights to exploit Morse patents, which Morse would regret, due to the money in the business
	- Cooke and Wheatstone have slower systems but their patent was from before Morse's
	- Alexander Bain makes chemical telegraph, essentially a precursor to the fax machine [[Answer to the Francis Bacon Question]]
	- Competing services create lines side by side, creating strong connections between certain cities
	- Eventually, Morse comes out of the legal battles victorious
- The ideas that make up these technologies are expanded on by others
	- i.e. the machine that would turn movements of a hand into electrical pulses, and send them to a receiver which would replicate these movements, to write
- On top of legal battles, there is also vandalism, cutting of competitors wires
- By 1851, Morse is triumphant
- Only 3 companies remain
- By the end of the 1960s, only Western Union remains
- **International Telegraphy**
- Around the world, experiments to spread wires across bodies of water are happening
- By 1858, a link across the Atlantic Ocean is created
- After a very difficult process, the link is created, but fails 
- within a few weeks due to experiments to try and increase the clarity of the signal
- Same year, optical technology is used to detect small pulses of electricity
- in 1866, the world is ready to try again
- The link of continents, and countries within them completely collapses humanities sense of distance
- Countries start to realize the advantage of controlling cables, Britain is especially at an advantage due to the amount of colonial territory they can control the infrastructure in
- Colonial implications 
	- Previously, it took 100 days to sail from Hong Kong to Britain
	- Marx and Engles comment on this in their writing
	- There is no scramble for Africa without the telegram, a way to communicate with far away territories of an empire
- Gutta-Percha: a tree whose sap can be used to create a waterproof insulator ^be3558
	- used in order to insulate telegram wires underwater
	- calculations suggest that by the early 20th century, approx 88 million trees are destroyed in order to harvest the sap to use in telegram wires
