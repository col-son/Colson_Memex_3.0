- How can you know if you're dealing with a problem that can't be solved?
- Alan Turing: Turing Machine
	- Think of a problem as a number of steps
	- Each observation a computer (human who computes) makes a change to their state of mind
	- Can the machine predict an output or predict if something will fail?
	- If a problem is expressed properly, this machine will be able to solve it
	- Machine depends on boolean algebra

- Howard Aitken
	- Harvard Prof
	- Creating a mechanical calculator to help with his thesis work
- The social necessity was enough for a mechanical calculator but not for a general purpose calculator
- WWII changes things due to the number of calculations needed to fire missiles 
- WWI these things were done by humans, mostly women, but the human computers cannot keep up with the demand in the new war
- Mauchly and Echheart
	- See memo saying weather calculations could be done electronicaly 
	- Create it, called ENIAC
- These things are programmed by women 
- Programming takes an insane amount of time, involving rewiring, reverse engineering, and figuring out what each individual wire does
- Grace Hopper
	- Codes a lot of stuff, not at the level of a coding language but at the level of electrical pulses 
- The ENIAC 6 
	- The 6 women who did the programming for the ENIAC, using actual wire connections
