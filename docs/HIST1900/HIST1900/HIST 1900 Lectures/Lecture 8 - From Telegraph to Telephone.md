- In a time period of about 30 years, technology goes from the phonautograph to the telephone as it originally existed 
- the telephone was an idea for a long time, and was once a term that carried a negative aura, as everyone knew voices could not be sent over telegraph wires
- Dates for telephone invention
	- 1840-Charles Page holds magnets near wire and makes electrical tones
	- 1854-Charles Bourseul creates a way to send voice over a distance by making and breaking electrical signals
	- 1954-Antonio Meucci, claims to have made a telephone before Graham, with no proof however
	- 1857-Johann Phillip Reis creates way to send sound over distance
	- 1876-Bell vs Gray both have patents for telephone going at the same time
- Earhorn: a competence needed to create a modern telephone, could pick up sounds and be used to amplify them
- Charles Page: Page effect, a magnetic wire can be used to transmit sound, and the intensity of the signal can change the tone
- The results of this work showed there was money in the business of the telephone
- It was also realized multiple frequencies, could be sent down the same wire, and there was already wires strung all over the place
- A missing piece: variable resistance 
	- the realization that carbon tubes can be put under pressure to change their electrical resistance, and the same goes for wires under tension
- also: the theory of language
- bad reputation of speaking devices
	- automatons had a bad reputation for being frauds, and so did speaking devices
	- Graham Bell kept it secret that he was working on transmitting voices, saying it was a telegraph device, so he would not be too shamed
- Elisha Gray, however, frames his more as a telephone
- Their work is actually slightly different, Gray's is better at sending and Graham's is better at receiving
- The dispute between the two of who made their invention first
- There is also the issue of Phillip Reis, who made an early telephone that sort of worked and sold them as a piece of lab research technology, not a telephone
- Gray vs Bell
	- Gray uses Page Effect to send electrical signals and sells it to Western Union, he also shows it off at the centennial exhibition, which is where he meets Bell
	- In about a month, he has a working telephone but does not fill out the paperwork for a patent, as it was just a side project
	- meanwhile, Bell does not have a big funding behind him, but wants to marry a deaf woman he knows, but her father will only allow it if he gets his telephone out to the public
	- Bell files a patent, but the device he's patented doesn't actually exist
	- He gets things working and holds public demonstrations
	- the receiver works fine but the transmitter is not great
- Thomas Edison and Emile Berliner work on a way to improve the transmitter, using material under pressure
- Bell buys the patent from Edison, Edison goes a separate way
- Bell, backed by his future father in law vs Edison and Gray and the entire Western Union group
- The main social necessity:
	- improving economics of telegraphy
	- emergence of the modern corporation
		- Bell company believed telephones were for business, not pleasure
		- they would rent out pairs to companies, and the Boston money market was a key player in keeping the company afloat
- phones were not a household thing until after WWII, as no one knows what the ideal business model for them is
- legal troubles among all the other developments
- things get heated until eventually an agreement is reached
	- Western Union takes the telegraph
	- Bell buys out the Western Union telephones, and will give 20% of rental fees for 20 years ^1e889c
	- Separation is created, the telegraph is for long distances and telephone is for local communication
- Telegraph boys were originally hired for telephones but were unreliable, and soon women dominate the positions
- Bell labs created, which work on improving telephone signal, especially over long distances, which is where the big bucks are
