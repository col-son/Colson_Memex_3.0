- Colossus
	- very early WWII computer
- Enigma
	- way to send encrypted messages
	- used in the German military
	- the more rotors, the more possibilities that can be used
	- Poland trying to crack the code, and figure out the three rotor system mere weeks before the invasion of the country
- Hut 8 and Bletchly Park
	- German machine cracked when a radio operator accidentally leaves the machine in neutral
- Bombe to Colossus
	- From calculator to computer
	- Key element is where the data is stored, and if the machine can change its actions based on data
- Post War
	- development slows, as there's no longer a large [need](Winston's%20Model%20for%20More.md) 
	- Von Neuman writes "first draft of a report on the edvac"
		- people in the field read this, get inspired
- USA: Project Whirlwind
	- began as an analog simulation for wartime pilot training
	- when ENIAC comes around, things change as outputs are able to be recorded, and it can adapt to input
	- new need comes around with the Cold War
	- becomes the core of computing of air defence in North America
- Lots of need during the Cold War
	- nuclear programs require a lot of computing
	- all these programs require relearning of code, a job the women are doing 
- Back to Britain
- Manchester Baby
	- built to test a new method of memory
	- runs a stored program from memory
	- much smaller than other computers
	- dismissed as just a prototype for interest  ^eb8429
		- [[Prototype Rejection]]
- Allies stop sharing info with each other
	- inventors also must stop sharing with their investors, which lead to rejections when searching for finance 
- Alan Turing
	- Moves to Manchester to work on computing in 1948
	- House is burgled in 1952, and in the course of investigation, he is forced to come out as gay
	- investigation turned on him
	- forced to either go to prison or be chemically castrated 
	- loses all research capabilities, and security clearances despite the fact his technology took years off the war
	- chooses to be castrated
	- commits suicide in 1954
