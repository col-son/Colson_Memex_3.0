- the ideas I mentioned in [[many platforms, same function]] and [[geocities and BBS]] are very similar. both are situations where things seem to have been the partial inspiration for Geocities
	- I suppose this is the nature of progression, and what this course has been showing for a long time. As technology is developed, other things are developed using aspects from all the new things being made available. 
- OH! this falls into the idea that it doesn't always matter who made things first, as certain things were almost bound to be made anyways!
