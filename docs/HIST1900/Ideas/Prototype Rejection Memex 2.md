- Aside from there not being a current need, I really like [Rowan's explanation](https://rowanegg.github.io/thememexofegg/SupplyDemand.html) of an alternate reason a new prototype could be rejected
	- Rejection of IBM cards, being dehumanizing 
	- "Perhaps society has evolved to the point where the needs of the government, and therefore capitalism dominate the wants of the people"
		- sounds reminiscent of my remarks in [[cutting costs today Memex 2]]
