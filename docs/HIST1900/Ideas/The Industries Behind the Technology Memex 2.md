- Sponge divers who discovered the Antikythera wreckage remind me a lot of the workers who would have been harvesting the sap from Gutta-Percha trees to make rubber for telegraph wires.
- Both industries take from the environment, which, although in different ways, led to advances in the modern understanding of technology.
- Come to think of it, an even more direct link: the original dive suit, created 63 years before the wreck was discovered (Marchant, 7), likely used the same type of sap from the same tree in the rubber used to waterproof it. 
	- Might be something to look into there for fun, although that's starting to stray from the focus of the course a little far.
