- lecture 18 is reminding me of an experience I once had 
- while searching for a place to get new flooring from we went to a warehouse, that happened to be the first thing that came up when searching "hardwood flooring hamilton"
- I remember my dad commenting on how we found the place, and the owner said something along the lines of "I pay good money to be on the top of those results"
- looking back I can't quite tell if it was a joke or not, but if it was truthful it shows the power money and companies have on what we see on the net
