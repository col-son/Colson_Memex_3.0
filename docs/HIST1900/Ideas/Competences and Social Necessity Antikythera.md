- As I said in my note [[website/HIST1900/HIST 1900 Source Notes/@winstonMediaTechnologySociety2002]], I feel that the model proposed by Brian Winston can be applied for a wide range of techologies
- In the case of the Antikythera mechanism, this rings true
- Social necessity: The need to track the movement of celestial bodies
	- As is widely known, these were of immense importance in Greek life, astronomy was a common fascination at the time, so this makes sense.
- Competences: The knowledge needed to build the machine
	- Comprehensive knowledge of how the aforementioned bodies moved
	- Mathematical knowledge to calculate needed parts and ensure calculations werw accurate
	- The knowledge of bronzeworking to create such an intricate device
