- Depsite the need for something, companies will neglect it to save expenses
	- This can be seen in Doodson's look at use of the tide-predicting machine
	- it continues very clearly today, companies laying off tons of workers
		- just a personal anecdote for a modern example:
		- at my first part-time job I remember there were originally 5 people who would close the store every night. By the time I left there were 4, and we also had to do the job of a position that used to work in the morning, that the company had gotten rid of. this and the hours I was getting were greatly reduced
