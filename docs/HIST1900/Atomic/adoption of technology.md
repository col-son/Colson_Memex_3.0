Reading this bit was sort of an "aha!" moment for me. Through the course, certain aspects have felt confusing but I feel like with things like this in the last memex, I'm really seeing how everything that we've learned really comes together and relates.  

For another example of what I'm talking about, [[natural progression of platforms]] was another example of where things just really clicked together for me.
