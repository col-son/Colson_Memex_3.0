In her book, Marchant goes in-depth about how the Antikythera mechanism was discovered, beginning with the background information needed to understand the circumstances of its uncovering. This includes giving a history lesson on divers who harvested sponges (6), the technologies they used (7), and the danger behind their work (9-10).
