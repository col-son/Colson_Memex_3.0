This was an annotation I made while reading [[@weingarttextmessagingworks2019]]. The idea here is very similar to something I was questioning early in the course, with [[Answer to the Francis Bacon Question]]. The second annotation also fit this same sort of theme, so I decided to put it here to save from repetetive notes. 

Long history to generic numbers in tech today. Just like IBM cards being the basis for how long lines of text in the terminal on a computer are.

> The allotment of 160 characters is a carefully chosen number, if you believe the legend: In 1984, German telephone engineer Friedhelm Hillebrand sat at his typewriter and wrote as many random sentences as came to his mind. His team then looked at postcards and telex messages, and noticed most fell below 160 characters. “Eureka!”, they presumably yelled in German, before setting the character limit of text messages in stone for the next three-plus decades.[^1]

> my wife’s phone sends out a signal to the local cell tower and gives it the number of the SMSC, which forwards her text message from the tower to the SMSC. The SMSC, which in our case is operated by AT&T, routes the text to the mobile station nearest to my phone.[^1]
