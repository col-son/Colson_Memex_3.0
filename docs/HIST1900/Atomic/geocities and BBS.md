This is a short annotation extracted from when I was reading *My secret life as an 11-year-old BBS sysop*. When described this way, BBS's seem a lot like the later platform, Geocities. It's really easy to see how Geocities would have come to fruition, seeing the existing technology that was being used at the start. It's all a very natural progression.

sounds a lot like geocities
