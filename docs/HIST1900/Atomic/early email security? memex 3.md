With the way early emails are described as being sent, it seems like they were very flawed from a security perspective. If this idea of "create a document in someone's folder" is the basic idea, could this not become very malicious very easily?

this feels like it could be potentially disastrous from a security standpoint. am I misinterpreting it or is that the case?
